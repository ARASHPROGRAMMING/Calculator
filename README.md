# Calculator Web Application

This is a simple calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).
- Responsive design using CSS grid.
- Animations powered by the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library.
- Clear display and calculation handling with JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main structure of the calculator interface.
- `style.css`: Styling for the calculator layout and buttons.
- `main.js`: JavaScript functionality to handle calculations and user interactions.

## Libraries Used

- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): Animation library to animate elements on scroll.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Use the buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Overview

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file defines the basic structure of the calculator, including the buttons and display screen. It also links to the external AOS library for animations.

### CSS (style.css)

The CSS file handles the layout of the calculator, making it responsive and visually appealing. The grid layout is used for the calculator buttons, and hover effects are applied for better user experience.

### JavaScript (main.js)

JavaScript functions control the calculator logic:
- `appendToDisplay()`: Updates the display with the selected number or operation.
- `clearDisplay()`: Resets the display to zero.
- `calculateResult()`: Evaluates the expression shown on the display and returns the result.
